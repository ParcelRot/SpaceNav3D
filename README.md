## Developing

If you want to develop for the plugin, you will need to download the 3DxWare SDK yourself from the [3DConnextion SDK Website](https://www.3dconnexion.eu/service/software-developer/licence-agreement/sdk-download.html) (requires free registration), and then extract it into the provided folder (ThirdParty/3DxWare SDK). The SDK terms prevent distribution by developers.
